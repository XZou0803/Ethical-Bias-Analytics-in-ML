# Ethical-Bias-Analytics-in-ML
This is a final project for Machine Learning. 

Dataset:Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
•11.7 million loan records reported by 7,062 financial institutions in 2014.  
•25 variables; Loan type, Property type, Action type…

**Research Question:**

1. Identify intrinsic bias

2. Mitigate the bias while maintaining or improving a machine learning model’s predictive accuracy


Package used: [Themis-ml](https://github.com/cosmicBboy/themis-ml)

**Conclusion:**

1. Race_other are more likely to get a loan at a 17.82% higher rate than Race_3, with a lower bound of 17.46% and upper bound of 18.17%. Race_3 is our disadvantage group or protect group.

2. Using Decision Tree and Relabel Target Variable to decrease mean difference without loss many accuracy.
